## üéÆ About

**Cuboc APS Edition** is our semester capstone for the UNIP APS project‚Äîa hands-on assignment where we demonstrate all the knowledge and abilities we‚Äôve acquired in our game development course. Based on the original [libgdx-demo-cuboc](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx-demo-cuboc) from Ludum Dare 48, we‚Äôve refactored, expanded, and polished the core experience to:

- Showcase robust code architecture and design patterns  
- Integrate custom level design, sound effects, and UI polish  
- Deploy effortlessly across desktop, web, and Android platforms
